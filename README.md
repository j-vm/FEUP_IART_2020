## Description 

### Assignment 1

In this assignment, the team attempted to Google Hash Code 2019 qualification round challenge through:

* Hill Climbing
* Simulated Annealing
* Tabu Search
* Genetic algorithm

Run solve.py 
Load file from Assigment1\inputs
Select the algorithm and specify parameters.

### Assignment 2

This assignment had the objective of comparing the effectiveness of several algorithms to classify a class from a dataset.
For that, we used the European Soccer Database from https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer. 
From this dataset, we tried to apply machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of a football match.
We start to analyze and normalize the data. After applying it to the three selected algorithms, we compare its results and effectiveness.
 
* Decision tree
* K-nearest neighbours
* Neural network
